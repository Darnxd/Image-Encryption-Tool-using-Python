# Image-Encryption-Tool-using-Python

A simple image encryption project using Python and the Pillow library.

It allows users to:
- Encrypt an image by shifting the RGB values of each pixel.
- Decrypt the image back using the same numeric key.

This tool **does not use any real cryptography** â€” it's more of a visual obfuscation method that helps understand how digital images work under the hood.

ðŸ“Œ Why I Built This

My curiosity about how images store data and how we can manipulate pixel values grew as I studied Python and cybersecurity concepts

This small project was created to teach you how to process images, manipulate pixels, and comprehend how encryption-like logic functions in pictures.
