# Image-Encryption-Tool-using-Python

A simple image encryption project using Python and the Pillow library.

It allows users to:
- Encrypt an image by shifting the RGB values of each pixel.
- Decrypt the image back using the same numeric key.

This tool **does not use any real cryptography** â€” it's more of a visual obfuscation method that helps understand how digital images work under the hood.
